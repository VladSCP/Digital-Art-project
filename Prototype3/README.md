# third official prototype of the project
new features: 
- colours are no longer randomly generated, now there are patterns
the previous way to store colours is still here, but is now called "free draw"
- function that generates random colours has been updated to include every colour possible
- a new combobox to select colour patterns
- the shapes now have outlines and the size of them and the colour can be changed in the settings
- increased the dots limit from 7 to 12
- no longer removes dots when shape changes
- every shape on every tessellation mode now stores its own dots
- the fill tool now has an option for right mouse button
- function that add dots has been updated: now insert a dot beetween the dots that have 
the biggest distance between them, if two such distances are equal, it will insert it
on the one that is closest to the starting corner of the edge
Also, the menu has been redesigned again
and the cursors as well
